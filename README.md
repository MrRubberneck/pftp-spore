# Welcome Home

## A Message for the Lost

Welcome back to the beginning. You feel lost now but have arrived at a place that can move you from the Lost to the Found; from despair to peace.

To feel lost is natural. It is the mind's reminder that, as social creatures, we need others to feel whole and have purpose.

## A Message for the Exploited

And Welcome to the manipulated. You have found purpose or conviction following what others have convinced you to believe. You may now realize you have been tricked into giving up some of your time and energy to someone who does not respect or even know you. You might still be exploited and simply stumbled on this tiny place. Either way, welcome.

## A Message for the Lonely

Welcome to the lonely. Just like the lost, your mind reminds you that we need others. Your despair can be resolved by finding loved ones and friends that genuinely care for you. In this place we hope to help you find those people.

## A Message for the Peace Seeker

Welcome Peace Seeker. Peace can be upon you in a short while. Your unrest comes from a void or an excess. You may have unsettling thoughts because you have too little to feel safe, or anxious and stressful because you have to much to handle. Here we hope to show you how to grow to fill your pot, yet refrain from spilling over.

## Welcome

Welcome to all.
