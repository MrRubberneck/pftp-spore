# Welcome Home

## A Message for the Lost

Welcome back to the beginning. You feel lost now but have arrived at a place that can move you from the Lost to the Found; from despair to peace.

To feel lost is natural. It is the mind's reminder that, as social creatures, we need others to feel whole and have purpose.

## A Message for the Exploited

And Welcome to the manipulated. You have found purpose or conviction following what others have convinced you to believe. You may now realize you have been tricked into giving up some of your time and energy to someone who does not respect or even know you. You might still be exploited and simply stumbled on this tiny place. Either way, welcome.

## A Message for the Lonely

Welcome to the lonely. Just like the lost, your mind reminds you that we need others. Your despair can be resolved by finding loved ones and friends that genuinely care for you. In this place we hope to help you find those people.

## A Message for the Peace Seeker

Welcome Peace Seeker. Peace can be upon you in a short while. Your unrest comes from a void or an excess. You may have unsettling thoughts because you have too little to feel safe, or anxious and stressful because you have to much to handle. Here we hope to show you how to grow to fill your pot, yet refrain from spilling over.

## Welcome

Welcome to all.

We're all human. We are no, however, one big family as some may suggest. Our minds are wired for small groups, but also, not too small. Too many people, and the group runs the risk of being exploited by the "wolf in sheeps clothing". Too few, and the group or individual may be exploited like a tool.

# Principles

Here are what I argue are the only principles that everyone should follow, regardless of what they believe, what they look like, where you are, and where you are in your life right now. You can immediately begin applying these principles to fix most challenges you are facing:

1. Acknowledge that you are human, a social creature, and need relationships to thrive
2. There are four groups of people
 - Self - a group consisting of just you
 - Loved Ones - your closest 10-12 people. Your Loved Ones are not necessarily blood relatives
 - Friends - people with whom you are like-minded
 - Others - all of the other people in the world. Billions at this point
3. Peace is found by doing the following
 - Control and Look out for your Self
 - Provide unconditional love to your Loved Ones
 - Support your Friends
 - Keep Others at a distance
5. Your group should be about 45 people, give or take 15
6. If you have less than 30, you are in need of other people
7. If you have more than 60, you are in excess
8. Groups in excess of 60 should split in two. 
9. The individuals in a group that is splitting must be allowed to choose the one they move too
10. The groups should split as evenly as possible. The groups that result may be in need and can find others
11. When given a choice between spending time someone from the group or with an Other person, devote time to the group.
